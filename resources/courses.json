   "Course Description": "The history of Shakespeare and (on) film is long, illustriousÅ¸??and prolific: there have been at least 400 film and television adaptations and appropriations of Shakespeare over the past 120 years, from all over the world. But how and why do different film versions adapt Shakespeare? What are the implications of transposing a play by Shakespeare to a different country, era, or even language? What might these films reveal, illuminate, underscore, or re-imagine about Shakespeare, and why? In this course, we will explore several different Shakespearean adaptations together with the plays they adapt or appropriate. We will think carefully about the politics of adaptation and appropriation; about the global contexts and place of Shakespeare; and about the role of race, gender, sexuality, disability, empire and colonialism in our reception of Shakespeare on, and in, film.Pre-1900 course.",

With this feedback, and the support of your Coordinator, students make adjustments to their job search approach and develop strategies for success in the following term for both job applications and interview performance. The importance of a job search network and research to tailor and prepare during your job search are also examined. This course is a compulsory requirement for the Arts and Science Co-op programs. Students need to pass the course before proceeding to seek for a Co-op work term, therefore, this course may be repeated.",

Then we turn our attention to our own domain-expertise, applying engineering concepts like \"balance\", \"flow\", \"amplitude\", \"dynamic equilibrium\"\"momentum\" and others to explore the ways that your technical knowledge can contribute to a deep understanding of happiness. This course is designed to challenge you academically as we analyze texts from a variety of disciplines, but it is also designed to challenge you personally to explore happiness as it relates to yourself, your own personal development and your success and fulfillment as an engineer.If the number of students electing to take the course exceeds the class size limit, selection of the final group will be made on the basis of an in-class assessment completed during the first class.",

Starting with the emergence of phantasmagoric visual entertainments (ca. 1800), this course reviews this rich and fascinating history in Europe and North America but also with a few non-Western cultural examples (e.g., Japan, Philippines) focusing on key case studies in spirit photographic practice. The course considers various reasons why people have wanted to believe in the veracity of these phenomena (e.g., followers of the religious movement of Spiritualism) as well as why others have wanted to debunk spirit photography as a hoax or fraud (e.g., Harry Houdini and P.T. Barnum). Exploring theories derived from deconstruction and psychoanalysis, we seek to understand the philosophical and psychological significance of spirit photography introducing constructs such as hauntology, spectrality, the uncanny, and the work of mourning. The course also reviews how contemporary artists (e.g., Oursler, Beloff) have incorporated motifs and themes related to spirit photography in their works.",

In this course we examine 'environment' and 'development' and 'human well-being' as inseparable challenges. We consider global, regional, and local environmental problems from the perspectives of developing nations, and investigate the economic, social, and political roots of these problems.",

Regular consultation with the supervisor is necessary, and extensive data collection and analysis will be required. Such a project will culminate in a written research report.Students must first find a supervisor before the start of the academic term in which the project will be initiated. They must then obtain a permission form from the Department of Psychology's website (www.utsc.utoronto.ca/psych/undergraduates) that is to be completed and signed by the intended supervisor, and returned to the Psychology Office. At that time, the student will be provided with an outline of the schedule and general requirements for the course, including the structure of the required log-book.Students seeking supervision off campus are further advised to check the appropriateness of the proposed advisor with the Program Supervisor. If the proposed supervisor is not appointed to the Psychology faculty at UTSC then a secondary advisor, that is appointed at UTSC, will be required.",

The seminar course will further enhance their philosophical abilities in an extension of PHLD88Y3. Roughly 75% of the seminar will be devoted to a more in-depth study of the topics taken up in the PHLA11H3 Introduction to Ethics. Students will write a seminar paper on one of these topics under the supervision of a UTSC Philosophy faculty member working in the relevant area, and they will give an oral presentation on their research topic each semester. The remaining 25% of the seminar will focus on the further exploration of the methods and challenges of teaching philosophy, benchmark grading, and grading generally and, most distinctively, issues of mentorship of new participants to the Socrates Project. Note: The teaching component of the Socrates Project will consist of the following components. Students will optionally attend two 1-hour PHLA11H3 lectures each week, and teach one tutorial of approximately 25 students, meeting with them for 1 hour every other week. Students will grade papers, hold office hours, and meet with the relevant professor as needed as well as provide mentorship to new participants in the Socrates Project.",

Strategic use of technology in all sorts of businesses makes the difference between success and failure for these firms. Wealth creation is a real option for many and the business atmosphere is ready for you! Increasingly, people are seeing the advantages of doing their own thing, in their own way, in their own time. Entrepreneurs can control their own lives, structure their own progress and be accountable for their own success - they can fail, but they can not be fired! After all, engineers are the most capable people to be in the forefront of this drive to the business life of the next century. This course is the first of a series of two dealing with entrepreneurship and management of a small company. It is intended that the student would continue to take the follow up course APS432 as s/he progresses toward the engineering degree. Therefore, it is advisable that the descriptions of both courses be studied prior to deciding to take this one. This is a limited enrolment course. If the number of students electing to take the course exceeds the class size limit, selection of the final group will be made on the basis of the \"Entrepreneur's Test\". There will be a certificate awarded upon the successful completion of both courses attesting to the fact that the student has passed this Entrepreneurial Course Series at the University of Toronto. The course is based on real life issues, not theoretical developments or untried options. Topics covered include: Who is an entrepreneur; Canadian business environment; Acquisitions; Different business types (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, and services); Franchising; Human resources, Leadership, Business law; and many others. Several visitors are invited to provide the student with the opportunity to meet real entrepreneurs. There will be several assignments and a session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.",

To what extent do audiences hold power to resist or negotiate with representations? How might we interrogate the notion that we live in a post-feminist, post-racialized society in which older ideas about gender, race and power no longer apply or need re-thinking?",

Increasing global recognition of nature deficit disorder and the values of green infrastructure to mitigate broader human impacts gives a new meaning to the term 'urban forestry', coined here at UofT and now recognized widely. Trees in and around the city are key to providing multiple engineered and ecological services that only recently have been brought into the responsible fiscal planning of every municipality around the globe. If managed properly (a key concept), urban forests mitigate climate change and urban heat island effects, act as carbon sinks, air filters, water purifiers, air conditioners, noise dampeners, wildlife and/or biodiversity refuges, and green spaces for the human spirit. Here, we explore the challenges and opportunities of this exciting new applied field at the cross-roads of ecology, engineering and planning to ensure future global sustainability.",

A key is to understand that engineers lead in ways that reflect their skills and mind set. The course begins with examining: 1) the meaning of leading (Why do something?); 2) the processes of leading (How do you do you create a vision and motivate others?); and 3) the tools of leading (What steps do you take to lead?). Learning frameworks and personal working styles inventories provide practical tools to assist the student to understand human nature and the logic of learning to become a competent leader of self, teams and organizations. The student prepares to become a competent leader by undertaking to learn (understand and integrate) key skills, character attributes and purposeful behaviours. The course presents strategies for development of high performance teams. Special attention is given to a number of subjects: transformational change, organizational culture, high performance work systems, and self-leadership. The course material is delivered through lectures, readings, in-class discussion and a team project. The project is based on the team interviewing the CEO of an engineering-intensive company or senior leader in the community. Students will be required to submit written reflections on course content and their personal experience.",

It also provides a critical framework to analyze and understand inequalities of an environmental kind. These inequalities are often based around identities of race, class and gender, such that marginalized groups are made to bear the burden of environmental externalities like pollution. Why are First Nations in Canada less likely to have access to safe drinking water? Why are industrial plants often in low-income neighborhoods? After critical examinations of the theories and foundations of environmental justice, this course uses a case study approach to understanding the concepts and the ways in which it has shaped modern society.

The Earth is an integrated system, where the ocean, atmosphere, life and planet interact with and affect one another. The evolution of the smallest organisms has drastically changed Earth?s climate, and small changes in Earth?s climate have a profound effect on the distribution of life. Understanding how organisms feed, breath, grow, and reproduce are integral to mitigating large-scale climate changes and organic cycles, and how this will affect the Earth as a system. Processes such as plate tectonics produces an ever changing surface, and has been a major control on how and when life evolved and flourished. After introducing how the Earth works, topics discussed will include how life on Earth has evolved, how large-scale geological processes affect climate and life and how ecosystems have changed in response to weather and climate change. We will also discuss the effect that our species has had on this planet; from the sudden shifts in stability of Earth?s systems, to feedback cycles, to use of resources and sustainability.",

The city is the setting in which broad social, cultural, political, and economic processes unfold, mediated and shaped by local context. Our focus in this course is the internal structure of the city. We examine the ways in which local experiences and conditions of urban life are shaped by social differentiation and processes of change. Our examination includes considerations of race, class, gender, and ethnicity in the context of urban life as a way of exploring how identity and place shape one another. We consider different theoretical frameworks that researchers utilize to make sense of both the persistence of old problems and the emergence of new ones. Instruction will adopt a blended approach in which students will connect the concepts covered in class discussion through field work based exploration of local urban neighbourhoods.

   "Course Description": "Engineering analysis and design are not ends in themselves, but they are a means for satisfying human wants. Thus, engineering concerns itself with the materials used and forces and laws of nature, and the needs of people. Because of scarcity of resources and constraints at all levels, engineering must be closely associated with economics. It is essential that engineering proposals be evaluated in terms of worth and cost before they are undertaken. In this course we emphasize that an essential prerequisite of a successful engineering application is economic feasibility. Hence, investment proposals are evaluated in terms of economic cost concepts, including break even analysis, cost estimation and time value of money. Effective interest rates, inflation and deflation, depreciation and income tax all affect the viability of an investment. Successful engineering projects are chosen from valid alternatives considering such issues as buy or lease, make or buy, cost and benefits and financing alternatives. Both public sector and for-profit examples are used to illustrate the applicability of these rules and approaches.",

This diverse industry has both high volume-low unit value and low volume-high unit value products, and the manufacture of each type of product has its own challenges. The chemical engineering profession applies the scientific fundamentals through two key concepts: Unit Operations as well as Flux. The fundamental elements of stoichiometry and reaction kinetics are further extended to cover the concepts of yield, conversion and their specific applications to continuous and batch reactor systems. Analysis of electrical circuits is introduced, leading to nodal analysis of circuits. The application of resistance in series and capacitance is extended into chemical engineering problems involved, heat transfer, mass transfer and momentum transfer, as well as reaction engineering. The laboratory will reinforce these key chemical engineering principles.",

   "Course Description": "Few questions are more obviously important than that which Socrates poses in Plato's Republic: \"how should one live?\" This course considers the various ways this question has been asked and the answers it has received across a range of very different contexts. It begins with Socrates' address to the Athenian assembly in The Apology and his conclusion that the examined life is the only one worth living. We then turn to the Greek past and the Homeric background against which the reflective life, that Socrates exemplified, stood in stark contrast. With this background in place we will proceed to consider the various ways in which the question of how one should live has been answered across of a range of social settings. Drawing on ethnography as well journalism and documentary film we will consider, for instance, Rastafarianism, Jainism, living \"off-grid\" in North America, deaf communities in the US, transgenderism, and non-binary gender identity.

You will grade their papers, hold office hours, and meet with the relevant professor as needed. You will be paid for approximately 100 hours of work each semester, for a total of 200 hours, at the current hourly wage for CUPE Unit 1. The second component of the course is a seminar that meets once per week for 3 hours each time, during the fall term. Most of the seminar will be devoted to more in-depth study of the topics taken up in the PHL103H/PHL113H; but you will also discuss the methods and challenges of teaching philosophy-grading papers, prompting and guiding discussion, and so forth. Third, during the winter term you will write a seminar paper, on a topic of your choosing, under the supervision of a UTM Philosophy faculty member working in the relevant area. You will also present your work orally at an undergraduate research conference held jointly with the Socrates students from the St. George campus. Admittance to the Socrates Project is by application only. Instructions and the application form are available on the web at: http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/employment/cupe-3902-unit-1",

It investigates the theoretical and political concerns animating South Asian cultural practices and their criticism (nationalism, Marxism, secularism, anti-fundamentalism, Islam, feminism, postcolonialism, issues of diaspora and globalization), and addresses the key question of how to approach practices of modernism and postmodernism in the postcolony.

   "Course Description": "The objective of this course is to provide students with strategies by which they can \"reverse engineer\" medical device products intended for use as implantable devices or in contact with body tissue and fluids. A top down approach will be taken where the regulatory path for product approval and associated costs with product development and validation are reviewed for different biomaterials and devices. This path is then assessed in the context of product specific reimbursement, safety, competitive positioning and regulatory concerns. Students will be required to use their existing knowledge of biomaterials and biocompatibility to frame the questions, challenges and opportunities with a mind to re-engineering products in order to capitalize on niche regulatory pathways. The resulting regulatory path gives a good idea of the kind of trial design the product must prevail in and ultimately the design characteristics of the device itself. The United States and Europe will be contrasted with respect to both their regulatory environment and reimbursement. Lastly, quantitative product development risks estimates are considered in choosing a product path strategy for proof of concept and approval.",

Following an overview of the Safavid revolution and the empire it created (1501?1722), we examine the political upheavals experienced in post-Safavid Iran throughout the 18th century that culminated in the rise of the Qajar polity. This review of early modern Iranian history will set the stage for our investigation of the defining moments in the modern history of Iran, including the Constitutional Revolution (1905?1911), the subsequent toppling of the Qajar dynasty, and the establishment of Pahlavi rule under Reza Shah. We then focus on the events leading up to and including the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the making of the Islamic Republic. The course concludes with an exploration of society and culture in contemporary Iran.",

The remaining 25% of the seminar will focus on the further exploration of the methods and challenges of teaching philosophy, benchmark grading, and grading generally and, most distinctively, issues of mentorship of new participants to the Socrates Project.Note: The teaching component of the Socrates Project will consist of the following components. Students will optionally attend two 1-hour PHLA10H3 lectures each week, and teach one tutorial of approximately 25 students, meeting with them for 1 hour every other week. Students will grade papers, hold office hours, and meet with the relevant professor as needed as well as provide mentorship to new participants in the Socrates Project.",

   "Course Description": "Complementary Studies elective Part 2 of the 2 Part Entrepreneurship Program This is part two of the Entrepreneurship course series. The student considering taking this course would typically plan to pursue a career in small business started by themselves, or in a family enterprise. The skills acquired, however, are very useful in any business where a graduate might end up in their career, without the need for actually being an entrepreneur. Our approach to teaching is based on real-life business experiences and many years of successful practice of \"what we preach\". The course contains very little theoretical work or academic approaches. It is designed to familiarise you with the kinds of opportunities (problems) likely to be encountered in an entrepreneurial career. If you really want this lifestyle and are prepared to work hard, we will provide you with the practical knowledge and technical skills required to pursue this kind of career. Topics covered in this course include: Marketing and Sales; Legal issues; Financing the business; Human Resources challenges, the Business Plan and many other issues. Note that the course material may be adjusted between the two courses as required. We recognize the value of communication skills in both the classroom and in project reports. In fact, we require that you learn how to present yourself in a business-like manner. As and when appropriate, outside visitors from the business community will join in and contribute to the class discussions. The course deals with practical concepts, actual past and current events and is presented from the point of view of someone who has \"done it all\". This means that what you hear is the real stuff. There will be several assignments and the preparation of a full Business Plan as the session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.",

Focussing on the social structure of the legal profession, the course draws on the sociology of professions and the sociology of law and covers topics such as the creation of the profession, competition from inside and outside, historical and modern challenges to professional boundaries, and structural transformations and shifts. The course will provide examples from global legal professions. It does not teach how to think like a lawyer, nor does it provide the perspective of legal practitioners, but instead it provides social science perspectives for understanding how the legal profession is organized, differentiated, and transformed over space and time.

The end product is a major engineering design report and oral presentation (including several interim reports and presentations). Technical aspects will serve to examine a \"cradle to grave\" view of a project, from initial planning through to final closure and site remediation. The course will include an intensive two-day Professional Supervisors Short Course. Topics include: Discovering a commonality among supervisors and their key role in maintaining standards. The importance of sharing information and expectations about costs, production goals and business objectives are explored in the context of motivation. The necessity of successful communication skills and techniques are discussed and demonstrated to achieve behaviours on the job, producing consistent results. A reliable methodology for handling difficult situations is provided. The fundamental rationale for safety and loss control is presented as well as a relevant perspective on management structure. A workable code of conduct that is a guide to professional behaviour is developed.

Fueled by technological innovations, these so-called FinTech firms develop products and services that promise not only great costs savings and efficiency gains, but that also threaten to eliminate century-old functions of traditional banks by digitizing and automating products and operations. And more than that, many of the technological developments allow new forms of customer-to-business interactions, new financial products, and new ways to analyze data. The course has two main objectives. First, it will introduce students to the emerging field of FinTech. We focus on two main technological innovations, blockchain technology and machine learning (which relates to artificial intelligence), that facilitate this transformation and that these FinTechs use. We will study the process of founding and financing of a FinTech startup. The second objective is to give students the opportunity to develop a viable FinTech product idea, based on a thorough analysis of the business models of two to three successful FinTech firms.",

With or without the gaming aspects, virtual worlds have the potential to support a wide variety of activities related to information creation, distribution, reception, and use in supporting social, economic, and cultural causes. Compared to everyday information practices, however, those enacted in virtual worlds are uniquely characterized by multimodality, synchronicity, digital embodiment and geographic distribution of users. In this course, students engage in participatory learning in virtual environments such as Second Life and World of Warcraft, using avatars to assess how the world's technological and social features support and constrain information practices. Using theories of gaming, virtuality, and information lifecycles, students critically analyse how information is produced and used in these environments. [24L, 12T]",
